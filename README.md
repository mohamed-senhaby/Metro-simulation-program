# Metro Simulation

This C++ program simulates a metro system with two lines and provides functionalities related to the metro lines, stations, and trains. It allows you to interact with the simulation by choosing various options from the menu.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the metro simulation on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)

### Compilation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/metro-simulation.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd metro-simulation
   ```

3. Compile the C++ program using a C++ compiler. For example, using `g++`:

   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o metro_simulation
   ```

### Usage

1. Run the compiled program:

   ```bash
   ./metro_simulation
   ```

2. Follow the on-screen menu prompts to interact with the metro simulation. You can:
   - Display station information for a line.
   - Display train information.
   - Simulate one minute of train movement.
   - Calculate the total length of a line based on speed.
   - Establish a connection between two stations on different lines.
   - Exit the simulation.

3. Choose the desired options and observe the simulation behavior.

### Important Notes

- This program uses basic console I/O for interaction and is intended for educational purposes to understand basic data structures and simulation concepts.
- The simulation involves different components such as stations, trains, and lines.
- The simulation loop allows you to explore various functionalities.
